# Microsoft Learn C# Developer Training

**🚧 Work In Progress 🚧**

A series of [Microsoft Learn Plans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/support/plans) put together to provide the skills and knowledge to become a C#/.NET developer.


## Structure

Each `Plan` makes up a `Part` of the training.
  - `Plan` contains one or more `Milestones`.
  - `Milestones` contain a sequential series of `Learning Paths`
  - `Learning Paths` contain a sequential series of `Modules`
  - `Modules` contain a sequential series of `Units`, which are lessons/projects
  - `Unit` contains reading material, an exercise/project, and an assessment.

> Each part's `Achievements` section is my own personal completed projects and not meant to be used in your own work.
